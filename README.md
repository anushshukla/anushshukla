# Intro

I’m a passionate engineer with a *B.E.* in *C.S.* & have an overall *~9 years* of experience in mostly developing products for early-stage startups while building teams & resilient systems through individual contributions, leading teams & managing projects. These days, 🌱 I’m exploring more about AI/ML, Blockchain, AR/VR, gaming, animation, etc. to upskill & reskill myself.

# Summary

Built consumer-facing **PWA** using **Next.js** (React) including SSR for SEO-friendly pages & **React Native apps** following atomic design & smart/dumb component patterns with friendly UI & great UX while delivering light builds with great performance.

Developed **excellent performing backend apps** following contract-first (OpenAPI Swagger using DTO) bulletproof web services in the form of SDK providing cache-supported REST & GQL API and having high throughput (> 100 RPS) & low latency (< 500 us ART) consuming low CPU utilization (< 50%) by using OST like Node.js based **Nest.js** over Fastify, Golang services for CPU intensive tasks & Python for ML to provide AI-powered features. Published SLA for Public API of the system.

Ensured **scalable & extensible codebase** by practicing best design patterns by following standard design principles using OOP/FP with suitable DSA. **Maintained high code quality** through reviews & pull requests/commits check for build, format, lint, & test coverage (>80%). Kept **code maintainable** through standard formatting, code writing guidelines, DAL with ORM/ODM  as DAO implementation, code documentation (dev comments), project documentation (Readme. md) & standard process management using containers (AWS ECS for **Docker**) & container orchestrator (AWS EKS for **K8s**).

**Designed data sources** with primary database in **MySQL**/PostgreSQL for RDBMS & OLTP, NoSQL DB like **MongoDB**, Cassandra, DynamoDb, Neo4j, etc. as secondary databases/misc. data storage & data warehousing in Redshift for OLAP.

Implemented cost-effective auto-scaling agnostic **cloud solutions** including cybersecurity and distributed system architecture using EC2, MSK, ElastiCache, RDS, ALB, CloudFront, CW, Shield, CodeDeploy, etc. of **AWS**. Ensured high availability by practicing best software architecture patterns & implementing observability using Prometheus & Grafanna other than APM (like New Relic) for performance tuning. Implemented **CI/CD** with Jenkins using Terraform & Ansilbe as IaC.

Contributed to **team building** through hiring with higher retention & lower attrition strategizing. **Led teams** in delivering quality projects on time with complete ownership & efficient project management. Published TD (technical documentation) containing system/detailed design with effort estimation/timeline including task breakdown with milestone deliveries by using Atlassian products (Jira & Confluence). **Improved team’s productivity & performance** through mentoring, training (upskilling), continuous feedback loop, yearly appraisal rating with quarterly performance reviews on business-aligned KRA with KPI, PIP, etc.
